					<h4>29 / July / 15 <small>By Corey Ghilarduci</small></h4>
					<hr>
					<p>If you're reading this, chances are you've come across answers to this question before. You've probably read this <a href="https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when">Github</a> page on the topic, then gave up. You may have also come across this <a href="http://igoro.com/archive/what-really-happens-when-you-navigate-to-a-url/">blog post</a>, which does a slightly better job.</p>
					<p>Here's my take at it-- in colloquial terms.</p>
					<h2>1. You type "google.com" into your browser</h2>
					<h2>2. Your browser looks up the IP address (127.102...) for "google.com"</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Browser </strong>checks its <strong>cache</strong>... if not found</li>
						<li><strong>Operating System</strong> (ex. OSX) <strong>cache</strong> is checked... if not found</li>
						<li><strong>Router cache</strong> is checked (aka the piece of equipment that connects to your modem)... </li>
						<li><strong>ISP's DNS cache</strong> is checked...</li>
						<li>Domain Name Server's (DNS) Recursive Search occurs, pinging other DNS for Google's IP address</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>3. Boom... You got that IP address. The Browser opens a TCP connection (a socket)</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>If you made a request through <strong>HTTP</strong>, the TCP connection opens up on PORT 80</li>
							<li>If <strong>HTTPS</strong>, the connection is opened on PORT 443</li>
							<li>The socket is neccessary to send and recieve information</li>
						</ul>
					<h2>4. A Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Occurs</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>A. The Client sends a ClientHello message with a list of specifications, like cipher and compression algorithms; the Server sends a ServerHello message with a chosen cipher and compression algorithm.</li>
							<li>B. Server also sends a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority; Client checks the CA for authenticity</li>
							<li></li>
						</ul>
